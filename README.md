System for Hardware-based Estimation of Relative Position and Attitude

This repository contains the various source code and design files resulting from a Master's Thesis project at the Technical University of Denmark (summer of 2017).
The project pertains to the development of a relative navigation system for use on satellites during formation flight, docking, or similar.

The system is based on Time of Flight measurements using radio waves and a novel approach to signal sampling.
Using the measured distances both position and attitude can be calculated in a local coordinate frame.
